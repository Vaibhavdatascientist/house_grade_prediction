House Grade Prediction using Machine Learning
This project revolves around predicting house grades based on a comprehensive dataset using various machine learning algorithms. The aim is to identify and predict the grading of houses based on several attributes, enabling better insights into real estate evaluation.

Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project comprises a comprehensive list of housing attributes encompassing structural, spatial, and numerical details. Some key attributes include:

Rooms, Bedrooms, Bathrooms: Spatial details of the house.
Flooring, Roofing: Structural aspects.
Lawn Area, Roof Area: Outdoor spaces and roof coverage.
API (Area Perimeter Index): Additional spatial indicator.
Expected Price: The anticipated price of the house.
Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Null values were addressed using various methods like mode replacement and filling zeros based on contextual relevance.
Outlier Treatment: Robust statistical techniques were employed to detect and manage outliers within the dataset.
Data Transformation: Certain columns were transformed from string to integer types for model compatibility.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Visualization: Utilized visualizations like count plots and heatmaps to uncover insights and correlations among attributes.
Inference: Discovered patterns such as the prevalence of houses without roofs and highly correlated attributes like bedrooms and bathrooms.
Model Building and Evaluation
Implemented several machine learning models including Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost classifiers.

Model Evaluation: Assessed models based on accuracy, overfitting, and their ability to predict house grades accurately.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuned the best-performing model using techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize performance.
Final Model and Prediction
Selected the Gradient Boosting Classifier as the final model due to its superior accuracy and minimal overfitting. Utilized this model to predict house grades on the test dataset.

Submission: Generated a CSV file containing the predicted grades for the test data.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the utilization of machine learning algorithms to predict house grades, offering valuable insights into the real estate domain. The comprehensive analysis and model building process enable accurate predictions, aiding in better decision-making for house evaluations.
